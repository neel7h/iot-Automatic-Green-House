# iot Automatic Green House

This project describes the design of a greenhouse monitoring &amp; controlling system based on
IOT using Arduino. People will be able to control nearly everything remotely, from how their
plants are heated and cooled to how often their gardens are watered. They will also have sensors
that warn about everything from excess of light, rain and temperature. The plants in greenhouse
is higher affected by the surrounding conditions. The significant environmental factors for the
quality and better productivity of the plants growth are temperature, relative humidity, Lighting,
moisture soil, and the CO2 amount in greenhouse. Continuous monitoring of these factors gives
relevant information pertaining to the individual effects of the various factors towards obtaining
maximum crop production. We can monitor more parameters like Humidity, PH of soil,
pressure, water level and at the same time control them. We can send this data to a remote
location using mobile or internet.
